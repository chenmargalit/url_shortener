Hi !

In order to run the project please follow this instructions:

1.enter the server directory and type in the terminal:
npm run start

2. While in the server directory, generate a new folder named config and a file named: keys.js and copy the mongoURI as stated in the email.


3.Do the same in the client directory (npm start) while the server is running.

Everything should work now, please feel free to consult if anything doesn't come up as expected.
