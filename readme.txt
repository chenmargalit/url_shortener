Hi !

In order to run the project please follow this instructions:

1.enter the server directory and type in the terminal:
npm run start

2. While in the server directory, generate a new folder named config and enter the keys file attached to the email. The db will not connect otherwise and this obviously cannot be in Github.


3.Do the same in the client directory (npm start) while the server is running.

Everything should work now, please feel free to consult if anything doesn't come up as expected.
